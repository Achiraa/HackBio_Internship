## *Introduction*

RNA-Seq is a powerful high-throughput sequencing technique that offers detailed insights into gene activity, enabling the discovery of new RNA molecules and understanding of gene regulation[1]. By capturing both the quantity and sequence of RNA, it allows researchers to study gene expression dynamics across various conditions, tissues, or developmental stages[2]. Unlike traditional methods, RNA-Seq provides advantages like detecting novel transcripts, identifying splicing events, and offering a dynamic range for gene expression quantification.

## *Results*

RNA-Seq has produced significant findings in various biological fields, employing both bulk and single-cell approaches. Bulk RNA-Seq analyzes from populations of cells or tissue samples, aiding in identifying differentially expressed genes and understanding gene regulatory networks in diseases like cancer[6]. Single-cell (scRNA-Seq) has the understanding of cellular heterogeneity, enabling the identification of rare cancer cell populations and revealing cell-specific responses that drive tumor development and metastasis[9]. These approaches have been instrumental in cancer research, particularly for biomarker discovery.

## *Discussion*

Bulk RNA-Seq is a cost-effective method for obtaining average gene expression profiles, making it suitable for comparing gene expression between different conditions or treatments[6]. It helps identify potential biomarkers by highlighting genes consistently altered in cancerous versus normal tissues. ScRNA-Seq provides resolution of cellular heterogeneity. This makes it valuable for identifying rare cancer stem cells, understanding the tumor microenvironment, and detecting cell-specific responses to therapies[9]. These insights are crucial for discovering biomarkers that lead to targeted therapies and personalized medicine. The choice between bulk and single-cell RNA-Seq depends on the research objectives, sample type, and available resources.

## *Methods*

The RNA-Seq workflow involves key steps common to both bulk and single-cell protocols. In bulk RNA-Seq, RNA is isolated, converted into cDNA, fragmented, and ligated with adapters to create a sequencing library[6]. In scRNA-Seq, individual cells are isolated using techniques like cell sorting or microfluidics, followed by cell lysis and RNA capture. Both protocols involve reverse transcription, amplification, and sequencing library preparation, optimized for RNA input size[9]. Sequenced reads are then aligned to a reference genome for gene expression quantification.

## *Conclusion*

RNA-Seq is indispensable in modern molecular biology, offering unique insights through both bulk and single-cell approaches. Bulk RNA-Seq is ideal for comparing gene expression across conditions, while single-cell RNA-Seq excels in revealing cellular heterogeneity. As sequencing technologies and analytical methods advance, combining both will further enhance our understanding of gene expression and regulation, paving the way for new biomarkers and personalized therapeutic strategies in cancer treatment.
